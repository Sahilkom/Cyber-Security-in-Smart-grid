# Cyber-Security-in-Smart-Grid
In this project, I have demonstrated a cyber attack in smart grid,<br>
and men in the middle analogy has used.

# Software Prerequisites:
1. Python Version: Python 3.6 or later.
2. Additional Libraries:<br>
     While not strictly required, consider using a well-tested library for secure communication, such as:
    <ul>
     <li>cryptography: Provides a high-level interface for cryptographic algorithms.</li>
     <li>PyNaCl: A Python binding for the NaCl library, offering high-performance cryptography </li>
     </ul> 
3. Arduino IDE: The Arduino integrated development environment is required to write,     compile, and upload code to your Arduino board. Download the latest version from https://www.arduino.cc/en/software.
4. Arduino Uno or compatible board: This code is designed for the Arduino Uno board, but it should work on any board with an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) and a compatible serial port.
